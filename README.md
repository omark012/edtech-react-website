># Online courses react website

### Live Demo : [Go to Edtech Website](https://omark012.github.io/edtech-react-website/)

Developed a leading education website UI using **React**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with a responsive design approach. The UI features a responsive navigation bar with a toggle menu. Implemented multiple sections like Home, Sevices, About, and Contact using **grid** and **flexbox** layouts, for touch slider functionality. **React Router** is also used for easy navigation between the pages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
